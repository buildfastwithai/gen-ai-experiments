# Report Artifact

Create a standalone HTML report from the final qualified prospect data. Use the bundled generator instead of writing report markup manually.

## Generate

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_report.py analysis.json outputs/customer-finder-report.html
```

Return a clickable absolute file link in Codex. Keep the JSON in a work or temporary directory unless the user asks for raw data.
