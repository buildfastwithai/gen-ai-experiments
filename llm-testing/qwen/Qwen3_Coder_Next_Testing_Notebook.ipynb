            "==================================================\n",
            "## Problem Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "The issue in your code is that you're using `requests.get()` inside an async function. The `requests` library is **synchronous and blocking**, which means:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. When `requests.get()` is called, it blocks the entire event loop until the HTTP request completes\n",
            "2. Even though you're using `asyncio.gather()`, the requests still execute sequentially because the event loop can't switch between tasks while one is blocking\n",
            "3. This defeats the entire purpose of using async/await for concurrent I/O operations\n",
            "\n",
            "## Solution\n",
            "\n",
            "You need to use an **async HTTP client library** like `aiohttp` or `httpx` that supports asynchronous operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's the corrected code using `aiohttp`:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "import asyncio\n",
            "import aiohttp\n",
            "\n",
            "async def fetch_data(session, url):\n",
            "    async with session.get(url) as response:\n",
            "        return await response.json()\n",
            "\n",
            "async def main():\n",
            "    urls = ['https://api.example.com/1', 'https://api.example.com/2']\n",
            "    \n",
            "    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n",

            "\n",
            "## Key Changes\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Replaced `requests` with `aiohttp`**: `aiohttp` is an async HTTP client that doesn't block the event loop\n",
            "2. **Used a shared session**: `aiohttp.ClientSession()` should be reused across requests for connection pooling efficiency\n",
            "3. **Proper async context management**: Used `async with` for the session and response objects\n",
            "4. **Async JSON parsing**: Used `await response.json()` instead of `response.json()`\n",
            "\n",
            "## Alternative with httpx\n",
            "\n",

            "#### 🔴 **Critical: SQL Injection (`/search`)**\n",

            "- **Impact**: Attackers can inject malicious SQL code to extract, modify, or delete data (e.g., `?q=' OR '1'='1` or `?q='; DROP TABLE users; --`)\n",
            "- **Root Cause**: Using string formatting instead of parameterized queries\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 🔴 **Critical: Command Injection (`/run`)**\n",
            "- **Problem**: User input is passed directly to `subprocess.run()` with `shell=True`\n",
            "- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands (e.g., `?cmd=ls; rm -rf /`)\n",
            "- **Root Cause**: Using `shell=True` with untrusted input + no input sanitization\n",
            "\n",
            "#### 🟠 **High: Path Traversal / Arbitrary File Write (`/upload`)**\n",
            "- **Problem**: User-controlled filename is used directly in file path: `file.save('/uploads/' + file.filename)`\n",
            "- **Impact**: Attackers can write files outside intended directory using `../` sequences (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`)\n",
            "- **Additional Risks**:\n",
            "  - No file type validation (could upload `.php`, `.exe`, etc.)\n",

            "\n",
            "#### 🟡 **Medium: Missing Input Validation**\n",
