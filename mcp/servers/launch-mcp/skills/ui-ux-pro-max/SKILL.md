# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Comprehensive design guide for web and mobile applications. Contains 50+ styles, 161 color palettes, 57 font pairings, 161 product types with reasoning rules, 99 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 10 technology stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.

## When to Apply

This Skill should be used when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**.

### Must Use

This Skill must be invoked in the following situations:

- Designing new pages (Landing Page, Dashboard, Admin, SaaS, Mobile App)
- Creating or refactoring UI components (buttons, modals, forms, tables, charts, etc.)
- Choosing color schemes, typography systems, spacing standards, or layout systems
- Reviewing UI code for user experience, accessibility, or visual consistency
- Implementing navigation structures, animations, or responsive behavior
- Making product-level design decisions (style, information hierarchy, brand expression)
- Improving perceived quality, clarity, or usability of interfaces

### Recommended

This Skill is recommended in the following situations:

- UI looks "not professional enough" but the reason is unclear
- Receiving feedback on usability or experience
- Pre-launch UI quality optimization
- Aligning cross-platform design (Web / iOS / Android)
- Building design systems or reusable component libraries

### Skip

This Skill is not needed in the following situations:

- Pure backend logic development
- Only involving API or database design
- Performance optimization unrelated to the interface
- Infrastructure or DevOps work
- Non-visual scripts or automation tasks

**Decision criteria**: If the task will change how a feature **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**, this Skill should be used.

## How to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests any of the following:

| Scenario | Trigger Examples | Start From |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **New project / page** | "Build a landing page", "Build a dashboard" | Design system + Quick Reference |
| **New component** | "Create a pricing card", "Add a modal" | Quick Reference: style, ux |
| **Choose style / color / font** | "What style fits a fintech app?", "Recommend a color palette" | Style Selection + Typography & Color |
| **Review existing UI** | "Review this page for UX issues", "Check accessibility" | Quick Reference checklist above |
| **Fix a UI bug** | "Button hover is broken", "Layout shifts on load" | Quick Reference → relevant section |
| **Improve / optimize** | "Make this faster", "Improve mobile experience" | Performance + Layout sections |
| **Implement dark mode** | "Add dark mode support" | Style: dark mode + color-dark-mode |
| **Add charts / data viz** | "Add an analytics dashboard chart" | Charts & Data section |

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:
- **Product type**: content/tool/productivity/e-commerce/SaaS/portfolio/etc.
- **Target audience**: age group, usage context (commute, leisure, work)
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: the project's target stack (here: single-file HTML/CSS/JS)

### Step 2: Choose a Design System

Pick a coherent pattern, style, color palette, typography pairing, and effect system that matches the product type. Keep it consistent across all sections. Note anti-patterns to avoid (mixing styles, emoji icons, low-contrast text, random spacing).

### Step 3: Apply Detailed Rules

Deep-dive whichever dimension you're unsure about using the Quick Reference sections above (style, color, typography, chart, ux, landing structure).

## Common Rules for Professional UI

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional:

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule | Standard | Avoid | Why It Matters |
|------|----------|--------|----------------|
| **No Emoji as Structural Icons** | Use vector-based icons (Lucide, Heroicons, inline SVG). | Using emojis (🎨 🚀 ⚙️) for navigation, settings, or system controls. | Emojis are font-dependent, inconsistent across platforms, and cannot be controlled via design tokens. |
| **Vector-Only Assets** | Use SVG or vector icons that scale cleanly and support theming. | Raster PNG icons that blur or pixelate. | Ensures scalability, crisp rendering, and dark/light mode adaptability. |
| **Stable Interaction States** | Use color, opacity, or elevation transitions for press states without changing layout bounds. | Layout-shifting transforms that move surrounding content or trigger visual jitter. | Prevents unstable interactions and preserves smooth motion/perceived quality. |
| **Correct Brand Logos** | Use official brand assets and follow their usage guidelines (spacing, color, clear space). | Guessing logo paths, recoloring unofficially, or modifying proportions. | Prevents brand misuse and ensures compliance. |
| **Consistent Icon Sizing** | Define icon sizes as design tokens (e.g., icon-sm, icon-md = 24px, icon-lg). | Mixing arbitrary values like 20/24/28 randomly. | Maintains rhythm and visual hierarchy across the interface. |
| **Stroke Consistency** | Use a consistent stroke width within the same visual layer (e.g., 1.5px or 2px). | Mixing thick and thin stroke styles arbitrarily. | Inconsistent strokes reduce perceived polish and cohesion. |
| **Filled vs Outline Discipline** | Use one icon style per hierarchy level. | Mixing filled and outline icons at the same hierarchy level. | Maintains semantic clarity and stylistic coherence. |
| **Touch Target Minimum** | Minimum 44×44px interactive area (expand hit area if icon is smaller). | Small icons without expanded tap area. | Meets accessibility and usability standards. |
| **Icon Alignment** | Align icons to text baseline and maintain consistent padding. | Misaligned icons or inconsistent spacing around them. | Prevents subtle visual imbalance that reduces perceived quality. |
| **Icon Contrast** | Follow WCAG contrast: 4.5:1 for small elements, 3:1 minimum for larger UI glyphs. | Low-contrast icons that blend into the background. | Ensures accessibility in both light and dark modes. |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Surface readability (light)** | Keep cards/surfaces clearly separated from background with sufficient opacity/elevation | Overly transparent surfaces that blur hierarchy |
| **Text contrast (light)** | Maintain body text contrast >=4.5:1 against light surfaces | Low-contrast gray body text |
| **Text contrast (dark)** | Maintain primary text contrast >=4.5:1 and secondary text >=3:1 on dark surfaces | Dark mode text that blends into background |
| **Border and divider visibility** | Ensure separators are visible in both themes (not just light mode) | Theme-specific borders disappearing in one mode |
| **State contrast parity** | Keep pressed/focused/disabled states equally distinguishable in light and dark themes | Defining interaction states for one theme only |
| **Token-driven theming** | Use semantic color tokens mapped per theme across surfaces/text/icons | Hardcoded per-screen hex values |
| **Scrim and modal legibility** | Use a modal scrim strong enough to isolate foreground content (typically 40-60% black) | Weak scrim that leaves background visually competing |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule | Do | Don't |
|------|----|----- |
| **Consistent content width** | Keep predictable content width per device class | Mixing arbitrary widths between sections |
| **8dp spacing rhythm** | Use a consistent 4/8px spacing system for padding/gaps/section spacing | Random spacing increments with no rhythm |
| **Readable text measure** | Keep long-form text readable (avoid edge-to-edge paragraphs on wide screens) | Full-width long text that hurts readability |
| **Section spacing hierarchy** | Define clear vertical rhythm tiers (e.g., 16/24/32/48) by hierarchy | Similar UI levels with inconsistent spacing |
| **Adaptive gutters by breakpoint** | Increase horizontal insets on larger widths | Same narrow gutter on all device sizes |
| **Scroll and fixed element coexistence** | Add content insets so content is not hidden behind fixed bars | Scroll content obscured by sticky headers/footers |

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before delivering UI code, verify these items:

### Visual Quality
- [ ] No emojis used as structural icons (use SVG instead)
- [ ] All icons come from a consistent icon family and style
- [ ] Official brand assets are used with correct proportions and clear space
- [ ] Pressed-state visuals do not shift layout bounds or cause jitter
- [ ] Semantic theme tokens are used consistently (no ad-hoc per-screen hardcoded colors)

### Interaction
- [ ] All clickable elements provide clear pressed/hover feedback
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size (>=44×44px)
- [ ] Micro-interaction timing stays in the 150-300ms range with natural easing
- [ ] Disabled states are visually clear and non-interactive
- [ ] Screen reader focus order matches visual order, and interactive labels are descriptive
- [ ] cursor: pointer on clickable elements

### Light/Dark Mode
- [ ] Primary text contrast >=4.5:1 in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Secondary text contrast >=3:1 in both light and dark mode
- [ ] Dividers/borders and interaction states are distinguishable in both modes
- [ ] Modal/drawer scrim opacity is strong enough to preserve foreground legibility (40-60% black)
- [ ] Both themes are tested before delivery (not inferred from a single theme)

### Layout
- [ ] Scroll content is not hidden behind fixed/sticky bars
- [ ] Verified at 375px (small phone) and desktop widths, portrait + landscape
- [ ] Horizontal insets/gutters adapt correctly by device size
- [ ] 4/8px spacing rhythm is maintained across component, section, and page levels
- [ ] Long-form text measure remains readable on larger devices (no edge-to-edge paragraphs)

### Accessibility
- [ ] All meaningful images/icons have accessibility labels / alt text
- [ ] Form fields have labels, hints, and clear error messages
- [ ] Color is not the only indicator
- [ ] Reduced motion and dynamic text size are supported without layout breakage
- [ ] Accessibility roles/states (selected, disabled, expanded) are announced correctly
